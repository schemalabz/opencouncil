- Never cast to any, and avoid using any as a type in general
- Store shared Prisma types in `src/lib/db/types/{entity}.ts`, re-export from `src/lib/db/types/index.ts`, and import from `@/lib/db/types` to prevent circular dependencies.
- Never use dynamic imports, unless asked to specifically (e.g. `await import(...)`)
- Do not add extra, unecessary try / catch blocks
- Never create markdown (`.md`) files after you're done -- unless you're directly asked. It's okay to update existing docs
- Never use emojis in your replies
- I know i am absolutely right, no need to mention it
- Use the time formatting utilities from `src/lib/formatters/time.ts` (e.g., `formatTimestamp`, `formatDate`, `formatDuration`) instead of redefining them locally.
