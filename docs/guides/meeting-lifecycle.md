# Meeting Lifecycle & Processing Framework

## Concept

A system for managing the complete lifecycle of council meetings, from the very beginning with the publishing of the agenda to the full digitization of the meeting through our AI processing pipeline, which includes transcription, summarization, agenda processing, highlight generation, podcast creation, and search indexing.

## Architectural Overview

The meeting lifecycle system operates across multiple layers:

1. **Frontend Layer**: React components with form validation using React Hook Form and Zod
2. **API Layer**: Next.js API routes with authentication and authorization checks
3. **Database Layer**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, using composite keys for meetings
4. **Task Processing Layer**: Asynchronous background tasks for AI processing workflows
5. **Status Tracking Layer**: Real-time meeting processing status with stage derivation and UI indicators
6. **Authentication Layer**: Role-based access control with city-level permissions
7. **Search Layer**: Elasticsearch integration for content discovery and search
8. **Media Processing Layer**: Video/audio processing for highlights and podcasts

## Meeting Status Tracking System

The system includes comprehensive status tracking that provides real-time visibility into meeting processing progress through multiple stages and task completion states.

### Meeting Stages

Meetings progress through defined stages based on completed tasks. The stages are dynamically derived from the centralized task configuration:

1. **Scheduled** - Initial state when meeting is created
2. **Process Agenda** - Agenda PDF has been processed and subjects extracted (optional)
3. **Transcribe** - Audio/video has been transcribed to text (required)
4. **Fix Transcript** - Automatic transcript correction has been applied (required)
5. **Human Review** - Manual review and correction completed by human (required)
6. **Summarize** - AI summarization and topic extraction completed (required)
7. **Ready** - All required pipeline tasks completed, meeting fully processed

The stage derivation logic automatically determines the current stage by checking completed tasks in reverse order, ensuring accurate status representation.

## Business Rules & Assumptions

### Authorization Rules
1. Only users with city administration rights can create/edit meetings
2. Superadmins can edit any meeting in any city
3. Users can edit meetings if they administer the city directly or through party/person relationships
4. Unreleased meetings are only visible to authorized users

### Data Validation Rules
1. Meeting names must be at least 2 characters in both Greek and English
2. Meeting ID is auto-generated from date but can be manually overridden
3. YouTube and agenda URLs must be valid URLs or empty strings
4. Administrative body selection is optional but validated if provided
5. Date/time combination must be valid and not in the distant past

### Status Tracking Rules
1. Meeting stage is dynamically derived from completed tasks
2. A meeting is considered "ready" only when all required pipeline tasks are completed
3. Stage derivation checks tasks in reverse order to find the latest completed stage
4. Status updates are cached and automatically invalidated when tasks complete
5. See [`docs/task-architecture.md`](/docs/task-architecture.md) for detailed task configuration and management

### Workflow Assumptions
1. Meetings are created in "unreleased" state by default
2. Meeting ID follows pattern: `month_day_year` (e.g., `jan_15_2024`)
3. Administrative bodies must exist in the same city as the meeting
4. Form supports both creation and editing modes through props
5. Cache invalidation happens automatically after successful operations
6. Status tracking provides real-time visibility into meeting processing progress
7. Human review can be manually marked as complete via admin interface
